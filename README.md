# 2048 Game (JavaScript)

This repository contains the code for a simple implementation of the popular game "2048" using JavaScript.

## Gameplay

In 2048, the player's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game starts with two random tiles, each having a value of either 2 or 4. The player can use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles in respective directions. When two tiles with the same value collide while moving, they merge into a new tile with twice the value. The game ends when the player reaches the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves left.
